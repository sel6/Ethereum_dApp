## Overview

In this project, a mobile web app will be developed to obtain location information from a mobile sensor module and confirm that the user is in a specific location. The funding will be given if the provided location and the required location are compatible. The Solidity programming language will be used in this project to create the blockchain concept utilizing an Etherium smart contract. The user can also view the status of his or her fund on the front end.

> ### Backend
The Ethereum smart contract. and supporting files for a truffle project. development and testing of the smart contract was done on the remix IDE.
> ### Frontend
Front end code for web and mobile dApp, using react and react-native.
> ### Test
The testing for the smart contract is done using chai, chai is one of the smart contract testing mechanisms out there. Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework. I used it to create a unit testing for the function I put on the above smart contract. The testing was done on an environment created by hardhat.
